# TopRatedPlayers 22/23

This project is focused on learning and training. The purpose is to create components, communicate with each other and incorporate buttons to go forward and backward while visualizing breadcrums.
For this project, I have chosen the 4 most valued players of the moment which are Kylian Mbappe, Eerling Haaland, Vinicius Jr and Pedri. I have displayed a home page with characteristic pictures of each one on which you can click and go to their characteristics, videos and career path in that order.
I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I have enjoyed creating it, thank you very much!

## Deploy

### Development server

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.3.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

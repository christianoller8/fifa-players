## TopRatedPlayers 22/23


This project is focused on learning and training. The purpose is to create components, communicate with each other and incorporate buttons to go forward and backward while visualizing breadcrums.
For this project, I have chosen the 4 most valued players of the moment which are Kylian Mbappe, Eerling Haaland, Vinicius Jr and Pedri. I have displayed a home page with characteristic pictures of each one on which you can click and go to their characteristics, videos and career path in that order.
I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I have enjoyed creating it, thank you very much!
